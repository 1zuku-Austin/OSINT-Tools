# OSINT-Tools
:eyes: Some of my favorite OSINT tools.
 
I have a longer list somewhere that I will add later.

## Tools
 - [Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/web7/) - Get info from lots of things.
 - [Metagoofil](https://github.com/kurobeats/metagoofil) - Extract metadata from popular file types.
 - [Recon-ng](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng) - For lots of recon.
 - [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) - Better version of recon-ng.
